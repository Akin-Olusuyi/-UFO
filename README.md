## Project Overview

To provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we want filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


## Results
The website is designe of the website allow for a relative ease of use. One can use the filter search section to quickly narrow down specific sightings. 

**Here is a screenshot of the website:**

As can be seen in the image above, to the bottom-left of the page is where one can make use of the filter search functionality. 
You can simply filter the table(info about sightings) by any of the filters or various combinations of the filters. You can filter by date,city,state, country and shape. 


## Summary

In summary the website is functional. However, like any other thing in life, there is room for improvement. One drawback, is the fact that you have to type your input for each filter. This creates the avenues for errors when typing and how do you know what values to type in? You will have to scroll through the entire table to spell check. 

There are a few things one can improve on the website:
    - Add a date picter for to the Date filter
    - Add dropdown menu for the remain filters (city, state, country and sphere)
